# Assignment 3 - Milestone 1

This project is part of the Information Retrieval course, In4matics 141. In Milestone 1, the goal is to build an inverted index for a given corpus of HTML/JSON files. This milestone focuses on indexing; the search component will be implemented in later milestones.

# Assignment 3 - Milestone 2
Use the following commands:
python index.py
python search.py

The first command will create and populate the index, and the second command will test the search queries.

# Assignment 3 - Milestone 3
Use the following commands:
python indexer/indexer.py
python indexer/search.py

The first command creates and populates the index, while the second command loads a local GUI that allows the user to query the index for ranked search results. In the GUI, simply type your query in the upmost text box and press the Search Button. The first query might take a second or two, but all other following queries will load instantly
